# FACE LANDMARK DETECTION

integrates the OpenCV and Dlib libraries to incorporate various models for facial analysis. Leveraging a pre-trained facial landmark predictor, the script accurately identifies crucial points on the face, enabling detailed facial landmark detection. Furthermore, the code incorporates a simplified head pose estimation model, utilizing the detected landmarks to estimate the orientation of the subject's head. By harnessing JavaScript to access the webcam and transmit frames to Python, the code provides an interactive platform for real-time facial analysis.
